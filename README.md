## purpose

This projects purpose is to give me practice with links, lists, images, and basic html.

## goal

After completing this project I will have demonstrated a basic understanding of how to structure plain html documents, as well as link my html pages to each-other with the href attribute.

## instructions

The instructions for this project were to make a website that links to three recipe pages, all of which are formatted the same.

## reflection

This was a good exercise to practice my understanding of these basic html elements. On top of allowing me to practice these skills, it also inadvertently let me learn emmet abbreviations (ul>li*8>p). This will be useful to me in the future.
