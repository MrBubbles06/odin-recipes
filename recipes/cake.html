      This is an old-fashioned, but easy-to-make devil's food cake recipe. Pound
      cake like texture and sinfully chocolately. This is from an old
      Philadelphia Bakery. Great when frosted with Chocolate Fudge Buttercream
      Frosting.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>½ cup butter</p></li>
      <li><p>3 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate</p></li>
      <li><p>2 cups white sugar</p></li>
      <li><p>2 eggs</p></li>
      <li><p>1 cup water</p></li>
      <li><p>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</p></li>
      <li><p>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</p></li>
      <li><p>¼ teaspoon salt</p></li>
      <li><p>¼ cup milk</p></li>
      <li><p>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and
          flour one 9x13 inch pan or two 9 inch round pans.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a small pan melt the butter or margarine with the unsweetened
          chocolate. Set aside to cool slightly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cream together the sugar and the eggs until light in color. Add the
          chocolate mixture to the eggs and temper mixture by beating well (so
          you don't end up with scrambled eggs!) Add 1 cup boiled water (still
          warm) and blend well. Mixture will be very liquid.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add this mixture to the
          chocolate mixture and blend well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix together the vinegar and the milk and stir into the chocolate
          batter. Pour into prepared pan(s).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until a
          toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cake divides well
          for filling with mousse, or ganache, or black forest fillings. The
          best clue to this cake being nearly done is that you will start to
          smell the aroma of chocolate filling your house!
